# Factory Method Design Pattern

The Factory Method design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling and enhances flexibility by deferring the instantiation of an object to its subclasses.

## Participants

1. **Creator**: The abstract class or interface that declares the factory method. It may also provide some default implementation for common operations.

2. **Concrete Creator**: Subclasses of the Creator class that override the factory method to create specific types of objects. Each subclass is responsible for instantiating its own concrete products.

3. **Product**: The abstract class or interface that defines the interface for the objects created by the factory method.

4. **Concrete Product**: The specific implementation of the Product interface. The Factory Method pattern allows multiple Concrete Product classes to be created based on the creator class and the context in which it is used.

## Benefits

- Encapsulation: The object creation code is encapsulated within the factory method and its subclasses, making it easier to modify or extend the creation process without affecting the client code.

- Extensibility: New subclasses can be added to the system without modifying existing creator classes, allowing for easy scalability.

- Dependency Inversion: The creator classes depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete classes, promoting loose coupling and making the code more flexible and maintainable.

- Testability: The Factory Method pattern facilitates unit testing by allowing the creation of mock objects or stubs to replace the actual products during testing.

The Factory Method pattern is commonly used in frameworks and libraries to provide a generic interface for creating objects while allowing customization and extensibility.
